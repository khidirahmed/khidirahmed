# About Me

Hi, 

My name is Khidir, and I am a computer science and economics major at NYU. I love to be involved in projects that I find interesting and unique. Building reliable and enjoyable software is my passion! 

A hobby I really enjoy is attending hackathons; I've attended a few so far and am scheduled to attend many more in the future! I like attending them because you get to code and build a really awesome project while collaborating and networking with great people. Feel free to visit my [devpost](https://devpost.com/kka6822?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav) and check out my projects!
